# RandomPlanetGame

Solo/Group Project that is the closest to the game that I want to make as possible

There are no graphics here, everything is coded into the terminal for interface

Information is soley displayed as written/generated text

Game is a Survival/Exploration/Base-Building/Defence/Crafting/Empire-Building/Etc-probably-more-things-than-that/Simulation game

For now, the player can simply explore a universe that is randomly generated and must recolinze the human race to a new planet

Using some technolgy, the player must rebuild and inhabit to expand thier empire

Empires can then interact with each other (not in this game, requires multiplayer connection, too high of a scope for this)
